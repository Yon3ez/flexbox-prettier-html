    <p>Sh*ttier is a code formatting tool designed to make 
        your code look as terrible as possible, embracing chaos and 
        messiness. It produces random indentations, mixed-case 
        inconsistencies, and unpredictable spacing, making it the 
        antithesis of tools like Prettier. While it functions
        deterministically, it is ultimately a humorous project more
        suitable for pranks rather than serious use. The post also
        advises against filing joke pull requests on serious
        repositories unless you know the maintainers personally.</p>
